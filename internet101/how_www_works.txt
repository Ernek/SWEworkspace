- What happens when you type a URL in a browser?
    1. Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
    2. Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
    3. The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)
    4. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
    5. The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each
